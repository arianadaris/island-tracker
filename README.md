<h3>An Animal Crossing website to track daily habits and goals.</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>I created this project to learn how to create a user authenticatino system and manage a database by using cost-efficient practices. I also was learned how to implement CRUD operations with a database.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
  • Helps me remember all of my daily tasks, allowing me to mark completed tasks and reset the taskboard when I start a new day<br>
  • Shows me the villagers in my town and whether I've talked to them or not<br>
  • Reminds me of overall goals I want to acheive in my game<br>

<h4>Features</h4>
  • Populates villager data using <a href="http://acnhapi.com/">Animal Crossing New Horizons API</a><br>
  • Allows players to add, remove and reset taskboards and lists<br>
  • Allows players to add and remove villagers to keep an accurate idea of who lives on their islands<br>
  • Players can access their tasks and goals anywhere due to the account system<br>
